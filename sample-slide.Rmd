## What is it?

The [.mono[R] project website](https://www.r-project.org):

> R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

--

What does that mean?

- .mono[R] was created for the statistical and graphical work required by econometrics.

- .mono[R] has a vibrant, thriving online community (*e.g.*, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)).

- Plus it's __free__ and __open source__.
