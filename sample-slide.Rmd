## FAQ.sub[2]: What is the ideal experiment for this setting?

Describing the *ideal experiment* helps us formulate

- the .pink[exact causal question(s)]

- the dimensions we want to .pink[manipulate]

- the factors we need to .pink[hold constant]

--

ðŸš§ These *ideal experiments* are generally hypothetical, but if you can't describe the ideal, it will probably be hard to come up with data and plausible research designs in real life.

--

Angrist and Pischke call questions without ideal experiments *fundamentally unanswerable questions* (FUQs).
---

## FAQ.sub[2]: What is the ideal experiment for this setting?

*Examples of potentially answerable questions...*

- **The effect of education on wages:** Randomize scholarships or incentives to remain in school.
- **Democracy and development:** Arbitrarily assign institutional types to countries as they receive independence.
- **Environmental cleanups:** Ask EPA to randomly clean toxic sites.
- **Gun laws:** Randomly assign gun restrictions to jurisdictions.

--

*Examples of challenging questions to answer (potentially unanswerable?)...*

- How does gender affect eventual career paths?
- What role does race play in one's wages?
